## Eclipsed Shadows

The dramatic jolt from the bo staff struck Sasaki, forcing him to retreat. 
Master Yamamoto advanced, each movement sharp and poised, his eyes reflecting an unwavering will. 
Despite the intensity of the fight, his face remained serene and emotionless.
With a swift strike to the head, Sasaki fell to the ground. 
Fear had consumed him. 
Master Yamamoto approached him, his steps deliberate.
“Why did you fall?” he asked, his voice mellow yet firm. 
Sasaki felt his master's penetrating gaze.
“Do you know I can kill at will?” Yamamoto whispered.
“Yes, Master,” Sasaki replied, his voice trembling.
“Then stand up and FIGHT!” Yamamoto commanded.
Though still gripped by fear, Sasaki stood. As his master advanced, the fear began to slip away. 
He stood ground and struck back, each blow transforming his fear into power. 
His mind became immersed in the spirit of his movements. 
He had fended off his master's attacks.
His fear was dissolved. 
His spirit was revived. 
The weapon was mastered.

## The Quest for Mastery
As I trekked across the treacherous crevices of the snowy mountains in my quest for truth, I ventured through every temple, sought out every monk, and consulted with every scholar I could find. My question was simple yet profound:
“How does one truly understand life?”
To my frustration, the answer remained eerily consistent: “You don’t.”
Unyielding in my quest, I traversed the majestic, untamed lands of Shambala, a land where the silence spoke volumes. “You don’t understand the meaning of life? How is that even possible? How does one find meaning without understanding?” I muttered through chattering teeth, the biting wind howling across the Shingong mountain’s valleys.
The night descended cold and dark, so I sought refuge beneath a gnarled tree, my thoughts as restless as the wind. At dawn, I ventured towards the temple perched atop the Shingong mountain, determined to seek answers from a new source of wisdom.
There, I found a monk sitting cross-legged at the temple gates, immersed in deep meditation. His stillness was profound, an island of tranquility amidst the encroaching cold.
“Hey,” I called out, my voice slicing through the serene silence.
The monk’s eyes fluttered open, revealing a gaze of deep calm. Without speaking, his eyes beckoned me closer.
“I have traveled far and wide, seeking the meaning of life. Every monk, every scholar I have encountered has given me the same answer: ‘You don’t.’ I cannot accept that. There must be a way to understand life,” I implored, my voice trembling with frustration.
The monk remained silent for a moment longer, then motioned for me to follow him. I followed, a storm of emotions churning within me.
He guided me through ancient wooden gates and up a path lined with blooming cherry blossoms. We arrived at a serene courtyard where a master stood, a figure of both warrior-like strength and monk-like tranquility. His presence was a harmonious blend of power and peace.
Without speaking, the master led me to a secluded clearing in the garden, enveloped by the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant murmur of a stream. His presence radiated a quiet, resolute authority. He picked up a massive stone and placed it before me. Its sheer size and weight hinted at the gravity of the lesson that was to come.
“Pick it up,” the master instructed.
I bent down and grasped the stone. Immediately, its weight was a tangible force, pressing down on my arms with a merciless heaviness. I strained to lift it above my head. My arms quivered, my breath grew ragged, and sweat streamed down my face as the stone seemed to grow heavier with every passing second.
“Hold it steady,” the master commanded, his gaze unwavering.
Minutes dragged on like hours. My muscles screamed in protest, and my resolve was tested to its limits. My focus narrowed to the singular task of keeping the stone aloft. The burden was overwhelming, and despite my fiercest determination, I could feel my strength ebbing away.
Finally, the weight became too much. The stone slipped from my grasp, crashing to the ground with a thud. I fell beside it, gasping for air, my entire body trembling from the exertion.
In silence, the master picked up the stone and placed it back where it had been. He then selected a smaller, lighter stone and held it effortlessly in his hand.
“Now, pick up the smaller stone,” he said.
With relief, I lifted the lighter stone. Its ease in my hand was immediate and comforting. I balanced it with ease, feeling a sense of tranquility and relief wash over me.
The master observed me in silence, his expression a calm enigma. After a few moments, he set the lighter stone down next to the heavier one and walked away, leaving me alone with my thoughts.
I sat in the clearing, the two stones before me—one a testament to my struggle, the other a symbol of ease. The contrast between them was stark and revealing. The heavy stone had tested my endurance, while the lighter stone had granted me relief.
In that silent, solitary moment, the truth became clear. The heavy stone represented the burdens and trials of life, and the lighter stone symbolized the moments of ease and respite. The master’s lesson was profound in its simplicity: both the weight of challenges and the relief of ease were integral to the journey of understanding life.
As I sat there, the truth of his demonstration etched itself into my soul. The value of persistence in the face of hardship, and the appreciation for the moments of relief, became apparent. In the silent eloquence of the master’s demonstration, I found the understanding I had been seeking.

## Killer Instincts

At noon, when the sun was at its highest, Master Yamamoto sat in lotus position, sipping his neem tea.

The open verandah, decorated with cherry blossoms, drew in the spring air as Yamamoto was lost in adoration of the Shingong valley.

It was my seventh year atop the mountain. I swept the crystal white marble floor directly behind the master.

Upon noticing him lost in adoration, I wondered if he had noticed me being behind him.

“Is he aware of me? If he is completely lost in thought, he wouldn’t notice if I sneaked up on him.”

Thinking thus, I slowly tiptoed my way towards him.

Yamamoto sat, still lost in thought. But something about him had changed.

He didn’t move, nor did he turn back. But the air around him seemed different.

He slowly opened his eyes and stood up, his body still facing towards the valley.

“What do you intend to do?” he asked in a mellow voice.

“Nothing, Master, I… I…” I stammered, my voice shaking in fear.

“Do you know I am a master of the seven styles of Kyokushin?” he continued, still facing away.

He turned towards me and walked, his steps deliberate.

Everything around him had changed. From a mood of intense bliss to the gripping weight of anger.

Yet it didn’t reflect in his face, nor in his body.

He walked towards me and leaned close, his breath warm against my ear.

“Do you know I can sense everything?” he whispered after a long pause.

Trembling in fear, I replied, “Yes, Master.”

And he walked off to his quarters, the mood instantly changing back again into the intense tranquility 
he felt when he was lost in adoration.

Such is the way of Wudan.
